"flex and bison" book

* version used in book:
  
  flex 2.5.35
  bison 2.4.1

  obviously something has changed for recent version that book's
  example fails to build.

* Chapter 1
** flex structure

   /* first section: declaration or options */
   %{
   /* this secion is copied verbatim in generated C file
   %}

   %%
   /* second section: pattern match and action */
   /* pattern _must_ start from line beginning */
   /* pattern prefer longer match, and prefer pattern appears first in flex program */
   xxx { /* action */}

   /* 'yytext' points to current matched pattern string */
   

   %%

   /* C code and functions, e.g */

   main() { yylex(); }

** "The Scanner as Coroutine"

   If action code returns, scanning resumes on the next call to
   yylex() ; if it doesnâ€™t return, scanning resumes immediately.

** context-free grammar - BNF

** bison structure (mostly same as flex)

   /* first: declaration */
   %{
   /* verbatim */
   %}

   %token xxx

   %%

   /* second: rules */

   %%

   /* third: C code, e.g */
   main(int argc, char **argv) { yyparse(); }


* Chapter 2 flex
